In this cases we proceed as follows: (a) when the administrative area is the union of multiple areas in GADM, we use the GID of the area closer to the centroid; (b) when the administrative area is a subdivision not present in GADM, we create its GID by appending .n_0 to the GID of the upper division, where n is a sequantial integer and 0 denotes the version number (read more about GID here).",External Keys,0
