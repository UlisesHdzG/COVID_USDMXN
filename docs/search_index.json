It represents an unexpected and unprecedented event that affected the whole world as a whole. Despite the common threat it represented (and still represents) for the entire world, individual countries tackled the pandemic with different approaches and policies. Such heterogeneity in government decisions led to variability on the pandemic’s effect in specific countries. While it is a fact that every country suffered negative health and economic outcomes, the main question that interests us is who did it better? In this project we will focus on this question for the specific case of Mexico and the United States. Specifically, we are interested in studying the main differences we could identify. To that end, we will postulate the following questions: Which economy suffered the most during the pandemic? How strong is the relationship between public health and economic conditions in each country? On a holistic approach, which government designed the most effective public policies to deal with the pandemic? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Health data 2.2 Macroeconomic data 2.3 Financial data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data that we will use in the project can be categorized in three verticals: Health data: Consisting of positive COVID cases, deaths due to COVID, vaccination and policy implementation. Macroeconomic data: Consisting of economic growth by sector and the inflation rate. Financial data: Consisting of market indices. 2.1 Health data For this category of variables, team member Ulises Hernandez located a very well polished R package COVID191 of data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This repository was initiated by Emanuele Guidotti (University of Neuchâtel), leveraged by David Ardia (HEC Montréal), enhanced by the open source community, and is currently maintained by Emanuele Guidotti. The initiative has aggregated data of many countries, but we restricted our use to only data corresponding to the US and Mexico. The variables in the data set can classified in three broad categories: 2.1.1 Epidemiological variables This group of variables includes the following variables: confirmed: Cumulative number of confirmed cases. deaths: Cumulative number of deaths. recovered: Cumulative number of patients released from hospitals or reported recovered. tests: Cumulative number of tests. vaccines: Cumulative number of total doses administered. people_vaccinated: Cumulative number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. people_fully_vaccinated: Cumulative number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. hosp: Number of hospitalized patients on date. icu: Number of hospitalized patients in intensive therapy on date. vent: Number of patients requiring invasive ventilation on date. population: Total population. 2.1.2 Policy measures According to the documentation of the data hub, policy measures are provided by Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker. As one can expect with this kind of data, policies not only vary by country, but even by region within given country. For this reason, the tracker uses flag variables to denote this limited scope of different measures. That is, the indicators have a flag for whether they are”targeted” to a specific geographical region (flag=0) or whether they are a “general” policy that is applied across the whole country/territory (flag=1). The compiled variables are the following: school_closing workplace_closing cancel_events gatherings_restrictions transport_closing stay_home_restrictions internal_movement_restrictions international_movement_restrictions information_campaigns testing_policy contact_tracing facial_coverings vaccination_policy elderly_people_protection government_response_index stringency_index containment_health_index economic_support_index 2.1.3 Administrative areas Finally, the data hub also compiles data on the administrative area: administrative_area_level: Level of the administrative area: 1 for countries; 2 for states, regions, cantons, or local * * `equivalent; 3 for cities, municipalities, or local equivalent. administrative_area_level_1: Name of the administrative area of level 1. administrative_area_level_2: Name of the administrative area of level 2. administrative_area_level_3: Name of the administrative area of level 3. For a more detailed explanation of the variables just mentioned, the documentation page of the data hub is an excellent resource for people interested in using this data set. 2.2 Macroeconomic data 2.2.1 Economic Growth Team member Abel Perez consulted economic growth data for Mexico from https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/indicadores/?tm=0 , in specific, he consulted the monthly approximation to GDP (which is quarterly) known as the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE in spanish). These data also present information about the production in different economic activities know as primary, secondary and third activities. The data was preliminary cleaned in Excel sheets (deleting comments on top of the data) and processed as presented in Chapter 3. The data spans from January 2019 to September 2021 (33 observations), and after cleansing it contains the annual percentage change on economic activity for total, primary, secondary and third activities. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 33 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Periodo : int 201901 201902 201903 201904 201905 201906 201907 201908 201909 201910 ... ## $ Total : num 1.376 0.984 1.032 -1.554 -0.467 ... ## $ Primarias : num -0.506 5.894 1.829 -1.581 -1.57 ... ## $ Secundarias: num -0.4008 -0.0918 -0.0231 -2.9824 -3.3431 ... ## $ Terciarias : num 2.387 1.276 1.517 -0.855 0.995 ... For the US, he consulted the monthly GDP from https://ihsmarkit.com/products/us-monthly-gdp-index.html. This data do not include detail on the production of primary, secondary and third activities. Furthermore the definition of such activities changes between Mexico and the US. To tackle this problem, he consulted Mexico’s aggregation of economic activities from https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieInternet/consultarDirectorioInternetAction.do?sector=2&amp;accion=consultarCuadro&amp;idCuadro=CR199&amp;locale=es. He then consulted the proportion of contribution of sub-economic activities in the US from https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind and aggregated the activities based on their definition in Mexico to compute weights for primary, secondary and third activities in the US based on Mexico’s definition. Finally, we simply multiplied such weights to the total GDP in the US to obtain the production for activities and then compute the annual percentage change (all this process is documented in the code of Chapter 3). The data for US spans from January 2019 to September 2021 (33 observations), and has the same variables as in Mexico’s data ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 33 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ OBS : int 201901 201902 201903 201904 201905 201906 201907 201908 201909 201910 ... ## $ Total : num 4.63 3.93 4.22 3.96 3.73 ... ## $ Primarias : num 0.125 -0.552 -0.268 -1.672 -1.885 ... ## $ Secundarias: num 3.65 2.95 3.24 1.27 1.05 ... ## $ Terciarias : num 5.03 4.32 4.62 4.94 4.71 ... 2.2.2 Inflation Team member Abel Perez consulted the data for inflation in Mexico from the Central Bank of Mexico’s System of Economic Inormation (https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieInternet/consultarDirectorioInternetAction.do?accion=consultarCuadro&amp;idCuadro=CP154&amp;locale=es). The monthly Index for Consumer Prices was downloaded and inflation was computed in an auxiliar Excel sheet as the annual precentage change of the Index. The data of the Index of Cosumer Prices for the US was consulted in a similar manner from US Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost) and inflation was computed in the same way. The data for Mexican inflation we consulted spans from January 2019 to October 2021, consisting of 34 observations: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 34 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ Month : chr &quot;01/01/2019&quot; &quot;01/02/2019&quot; &quot;01/03/2019&quot; &quot;01/04/2019&quot; ... ## $ INPC : num 103 103 103 104 103 ... ## $ Annual_Inflation: num 0.0437 0.0394 0.04 0.0441 0.0428 ... The data for US inflation spans from January 2012 to October 2021 (we will only focus on the intersection of time windows with Mexico), consisting of 118 observations: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 118 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ Year : int 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 ... ## $ Month : chr &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; ... ## $ Price : num 227 228 229 230 230 ... ## $ inflation: num 0.0293 0.0287 0.0265 0.023 0.017 ... 2.3 Financial data For this category of variables, team member Gilberto Garcia used the R package tidyquant, which connects to number of data sources including Yahoo Finance, Morningstar, Quandl, FRED Economic Data and more, to download the data in a format compatible with tidyverse. The code used to download this data can be found here. In the case of the United States, given that there are plenty of well maintained financial data sources, we decided to pick the S&amp;P 500 index as a representative proxy of the health of the American financial market, and also obtained data on the 11 sectors making up the index: Materials Health Care Consumer Staples Consumer Discretionary Energy Financials Industrials Technology Utilities Real State Communication Services In the case of Mexico there was a natural limitation, which is that the size of the Mexican financial market is much smaller in terms of number of companies and market capitalization. As a reference, the Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC), the only Mexican stock index, is composed of around 35 publicly traded companies. We gathered data on this index, but were unable to obtained sectorized data because of this limitation. The API we used downloaded these data as a data frame with 9,671 observations and 8 columns. The columns correspond to the following variables: symbol (ticker), date, open price of trading day , highest price of trading day , lowest price of trading day , closing price of trading, volume of trading, and finally and most importantly the adjusted price of the index, which is the price adjusted by corporate actions and is the relevant price we have to focus. Finally, for the purposes of making value comparison across countries, we downloaded data on the exchange rate between the Mexican Peso and the US dollar.

As is natural with time-series data, many of the transformations had to do with a way of dealing with trends or change in the longitudinal, although in some instances this trending behaviour was desired in order to make proper comparisons. 3.1 Health variables In this category of variables, the main purpose of the transformations was to provide a way to make comparison of daily cases and deaths related to COVID-19, and also vaccination rates when this information became available. The methodology we followed was to take the ratio of the Mexican target metric over the American target metric. For example, in the case of daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, we created a new time series that was calculated as by dividing the daily count of COVID-19 cases in Mexico divided by the corresponding daily count of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Therefore, a number greater that 1 for this index means that coronavirus cases in Mexico increased more rapidly than cases in the United States, and vice versa for an index value less than 1. The code we used for transforming this data can be found here. 3.2 Economic variables The main challenge in this category of data was to match the different definitions of economic activity in the Mexican and in the US. Government agencies in Mexico and the US follow classifications of economic enterprises and data, and hence, the bulk of the transformations we used here focused on making an appropriate matching of levels in the two countries. 3.3 Financial variables Finally, financial variables data required the standardization of the price (levels) of the different indices that were gathered, in a way that would clearly show the sectors and indices that outperformed the index average, as well as to give a clear picture of abrupt movement of financial markets when pandemic begun. In addition, given that this data was downloaded through an API, the data required the usual pivot longer transformations in order to be arranged in a desired format. The code we used to download these data and make the initial set of transformations can be found here. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Our data consists of three different kind of data; macroeconomic and financial information that don’t contain missing values, mainly due to the structured nature of such information, and health data that does contain missing values. In this chapter, we analyze the missing data patterns that are presented in the health data from Mexico and USA, using the function visualize_missings. The code of the function can be found here. library(dplyr) library(tidyr) source(&quot;missing_visualization.R&quot;) inflation_mx &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/COVID_mex.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) inflation_us &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/COVID_usa.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) names(inflation_mx)&lt;-c(&quot;date&quot;,&quot;confirmed&quot;,&quot;deaths&quot;, &quot;recovered&quot;,&quot;tests&quot;,&quot;vaccines&quot;, &quot;peop_vacc&quot;,&quot;peop_f_vac&quot;,&quot;hosp&quot;,&quot;icu&quot;,&quot;vent&quot;,&quot;population&quot;, &quot;school_close&quot;,&quot;workpl_close&quot;,&quot;cancel_events&quot;,&quot;gatherings_res&quot;, &quot;transport_close&quot;,&quot;stay_home_r&quot;,&quot;int_move_rest&quot;, &quot;internat_move_rest&quot;, &quot;inf_camp&quot;, &quot;test_policy&quot;,&quot;contact_trace&quot;, &quot;facial_cover&quot;, &quot;vaccin_policy&quot;, &quot;elderly_peop_protec&quot;, &quot;gover_resp_ind&quot;, &quot;string_ind&quot;, &quot;cont_health_ind&quot;,&quot;econ_supp_ind&quot; ) names(inflation_us)&lt;-names(inflation_mx) Mexico missing values plots visualize_missings(inflation_mx) visualize_missings(inflation_mx,percent = T) USA missing values plots visualize_missings(inflation_us) visualize_missings(inflation_us,percent = T) We can observe that there are no complete cases in any of the health data sets. This can be explained by the difficulty of gathering data in a health crisis and that some variables were not present at some point of the time considered, such as vaccinated people at the very beginning of the pandemic. Other possible reason is that the country does not release that kind of data for the public. Particularly, for each country we have the following insights: Mexico. From the missing values plots we can observe: There are 14 missing values pattern in the dataset of Mexico. There are three variables that have all their values as missing, and they represent the second most popular missing pattern in the data with presence in around 20% of the rows: Number of hospitalized patients on date (hosp); Number of hospitalized patients in intensive therapy on date (icu); Number of patients requiring invasive ventilation on date (vent). This pattern suggests that this data is not release by the country. The pattern with most missing values is the one that includes the three above variables and vaccines related variables, with presence in around 35% of the rows: Cumulative number of total doses administered (vaccines), Cumulative number of people who received at least one vaccine dose (peop_vacc) and Cumulative number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol (peop_f_vac). The missing values from vaccination data is clearly because there were not vaccines available at the beginning of the pandemic. All the aforementioned variables and the recovered variable are the ones that have the most missing values observations among all the variables. This can suggests that the country could have had issues related to vaccines and in reporting recovered patients data. USA: From the missing values plots we can observe: There are fewer number of missing value patters, compared to Mexico. The dataset for USA has 6 missing values patterns. There are two variables with all of their values as missings and that represent the most frequent pattern of missing values: recovered and vent. This pattern is present in almost 50% of the rows. The second most popular pattern with around 20% of the rows contains the two variables mentioned above and the variables related to vaccines: peop_f_vac, peop_vacc and vaccines. The last pattern with significant presence in the data (around 20%) contain all the aforementioned variables and the variables hosp and icu. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Which economy suffered the most during the pandemic? 5.2 Relation between public health and economic conditions in each country 5.3 Which government designed the most effective public policies to deal with the pandemic?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Which economy suffered the most during the pandemic? 5.1.1 Health Vertical Th first thing that comes to mind when thinking the pandemic’s effect in a particular country are daily infection cases. In order to compare such infections between countries, here we present a time-series plot to compare daily cases in each country. To make the comparison fair among the two countries, we present the cases per 100,000 population from 2020-01-25 to 2021-11-27. For visualization purposes, we compute the 7-day moving average of the series. We can observe that the US consistently reports more infection cases per capita than Mexico. US also shows evidence of more waves than Mexico: two little waves before 2020-08-11, in a period in which Mexico only experienced one, and another little wave directly after the big 2020 winter wave. Despite the previous, both countries follow a somewhat similar trend in the three big waves that we may categorize as the initial wave with peak around July 2020, the 2020 winter wave, and the most recent wave with peak around August 2021. We now focus on what can be considered as the most important severity indicator in the pandemic: number of deaths. In the same spirit of the previous comparison, here we present daily death per Daily deaths per 10 million population. We can appreciate an interesting behavior. Unlike the reported active cases, deaths per capita are similar between the two countries, whith one being on top of the other only momentarily. Here we can see with more influence the effect of the three waves in both countries. In the first one, US started having more deaths earlier than Mexico, but was surpased by it around early July 2020 until the second wave in winter 2020 increased the deaths with more acceleration in the US but it was followed shortly after by Mexico. Unlike the first to waves when the US preceded Mexico, in the third one it was Mexico the country that started suffering the death toll earlier, and it was followed shortly after by the US. Both countries suffered similar death tolls across the pandemic but the US had more reported infection cases. This may be explained by the US having better healthcare system and coverage, something that Mexico may lack making infections more likely to end in a regrettable death. 5.1.2 Economic and Financial Vertical We first turn our attention to annual economic growth of the two countries. In Figure 3 we display the monthly series of annual percentage change of GDP for Mexico and the US from January 2020 to September 2021. We can see that prior to March 2020, both economies had a steady economic growth (in the case of Mexico, there was a recession actually), and when the governments decided to close interaction activities, the production in the US droped to negative levels and actually tied the decrease in Mexico, so we can say the US was the economy that reacted the most at the beginning, from 4.42% to -1.38% (Mexico moved from -0.107% to -2.17% in the same period). However, Mexico was the country that suffered the greatest downfall in production across the time window, with a huge -22.86% growth in March and a consistently less growth in the following months, except for May and June 2021, where the arithmetic effect of having a small production one year ago (first wave of the pandemic), will make the high growth seem as product of an increase of the current production when it is actually due to a devastating decrease of the past one. It is worth nothing that it was only in the beginning of the pandemic that both economies suffered such an unprecedented decrease, as the second and third waves around winter 2020 and August 2021 (see Fig. 2) did not have the same impact as the first. The is may be explained due to the closing policies being more relaxed after the first tight lock down, something we will explore in section 5.3. We now turn attention on the impact f the pandemic at sub levels of economic activities. To analyze with more detail the difference in impact between countries, we compute the difference in growth, that is \\(\\Delta US_k - \\Delta MX_k\\) where \\(\\Delta US_k\\) represents the annual growth in the US for economic activity \\(k \\in\\) (primary, secondary, tertiary). We see in all cases the difference in growth has median greater than 0, which tells us about a greater recession in Mexico than in US. Tertiary activities show the greatest difference with a median difference of more than 5 percentage points, which indicates that the US has greater resilience in all sectors, but specially in service activities. It is worth noting that primary and secondary activities have the first quarter less than 0, indicating that around 25% of the times, Mexico showed a higher economic growth during the pandemic. This speaks of an economy that focuses more in extraction of raw materials and manufacturing than in services, when compared to US’ standards. We now turn our attention to inflation and its relation to economic activity, to see the effects of the pandemic in the prices of each economy from January 2020 to September 2021. We can see that the initial lock down decreased both the economic growth and inflation rate in the two countries, this is a natural consequence of less activity implying less demand for products and services and as such, a decrease in prices and in inflation. However, as the economic growth (dashed lines) started increasing, product of the reopening of both economies around June 2020, the inflation increased to levels higher than before the pandemic, and even when the economic activity started decreasing after June 2021 towards its pre-pandemic state, the inflation still seems to be in a positive trend. In this case again, Mexico is the country experiencing harder consequences as inflation is consistently higher than in the US, and the last observed months (August to September 2021), show a greater slope than the US. We now will turn to analyzing the performance of the financial stock markets throughout the evolution of the pandemic. We now present a comparison of the stock indexes in both countries, indexed at the same level at the end of 2019, we can observe that the Mexican market slightly under performs the american reference (S&amp;P500), but this is misleading because after adjusting by the exchange rate, the effect is more severe as the demand for US dollars was globally exacerbated. We now turn our attention to the sector in the US market. Given that we have sectorized of the US stock market, we decided to create a heat map of these sectors to see which aspect of economic activity was perceived to be most affected by market participants. We can observe that energy was the sector most impacted by the pandemic as governments soon started imposing travel restrictions which greatly diminished the outlook for the price of oil in the following months. This expectation came to be realized as the enegy index is the only sector of the S&amp;P 500 that has not recovered its pre-pandemic level. In addition, we can also observe that the Technology sector not only has been the most resilient during the pandemic, but has had a strong rally during the pandemic, something that is explained by the strong demand of IT hardware and services as companies had to migrate to a remote work environment. Finally, something that come as a surprise to us was the relatively strong performance of the sector of Consumer Discretionary products. This sector tracks companies delivering goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Representative companies within this sector are Amazon, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Nike and Lowe’s. Although at first glance one would have thought that people would prioritize savings over non-essential consumption, the massive financial aid programs that went into effect seem to have supported discretionary spending by American households. 5.2 Relation between public health and economic conditions in each country We first focus on the impact the pandemic had in the economic activity of the two countries. For this, we display scatterplots of economic growth vs monthly deaths for the two countries, and estimate a regression line in order to asses the level of association between what can be seen as the hardest severity indicator of the pandemic, and the overall economic outlook of a country. We also print the estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficient that relates the death counts to the economic growth. We can see that the fitted line in both cases shows a negative trend, indicating that higher the deaths, lower the economic growth. The estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficient for mexico is greater in absolute value, pointing out that for this country the economic fallout was worse. 5.3 Which government designed the most effective public policies to deal with the pandemic? To analyze the policy evolution of the two countries, we count the number of active anti-COVID policies in a given day, among the following 14: School closing, workplace closing, cancel events, gatherings restrictions, transport closing, stay_home restrictions internal_movement restrictions, international movement restrictions, information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, vaccination policy, elderly people protection. This variables gives us information about each policy’s status in the whole country. We construct a discrete time series for each country that bounded to be between 0 and 14. We display it together with the smoothed daily per capita deaths of each country. We can see that the US started implementing policies (solid blue line) before the pandemic started in the country and in advance of Mexico. The US stabilized the number of policies around 6 until the second wave of winter 2020 when it reached around 9. After the second wave the US decreased the number of policies to just 5: international movement restrictions, information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing and vaccination policy. In contrast, Mexico overreacted in the beginning of the pandemic by rapidly increasing the restriction policies to 11. Realizing this overreaction, the government then decreased the number to around 8 and has been decreasing it with time. In average, Mexico has been more restrictive as the number of policies is greater than the US in many periods. In contrast the US has been more precise by implementing policies in advance, not overreacting and increasing them only in the most complex periods (near the peak of the second wave). It is also worth noting that even when US implemented less policies in average, the deaths per capita are similar, which reinforces the argument of a better implemented set of policies.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Health dimension 7.2 Economic and financial impact and recovery", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Health dimension As was a common phenomenon worldwide, health officials and governments around the world did not took enough measures to mitigate the rapid spread of the virus in early February and March of 2020, and Mexico and the US were no exceptions. As the first cases outside China were appearing around the world, health and epidemiological agencies started sounding the alarms in both countries. Nonotheless, the executive branches of both countries did not take appropiate measures and clusters of cases begun to appear in American cities such as Seattle and New York. Given the status of the US as an international hub, it does not come as a surprise that covid cases started ro rapidly increase sharply in the US. Subsequently, as the virus propagated around the world, cases in Mexico naturally started to increase as well. One of the lessons of our analysis is that Mexican official consistently lagged the US measures to control the spread of the virus, and when they did react, the measures imposed in Mexico were more way more stringent and often times it was an over-reaction to the current state of the pandemic (Chapter 5.3). In addition, despite the higher inflation rate in the US, the per capita mortality was similar between both countries, which indicates a higher severity in Mexico. However, one possible limitation of our analysis that COVID-19 data reported in both countries does not reflect the way higher number of COVID-19 tests that were performed in US as compared to Mexico, something that arguably contributed to an under reporting the death toll related to the pandemic. 7.2 Economic and financial impact and recovery In economic and financial terms, it was also evident that the pandemic had a more severe impact in Mexico than in the US, measured by a larger drop in economic output and higher inflation rate in recent months. In addition, the status of the US as a safe haven of assets, caused the US dollar sharply increase its value relative to the Mexican peso, as well as stock markets around the world to dramatically under perform its American counterparts, even as in the US the outlook for financial assets was not very good in the initial months of the pandemic. This was clearly reflected our analysis of associations that we performed in previous sections. The pandemic data clearly had a larger impact Mexico than in the US, both, in terms of financials markets and economic measures of activity However, we would have liked to have more segregated data for financial data in Mexico in order to also analyze the impact of the pandemic in different sectors of the Mexican economic.
